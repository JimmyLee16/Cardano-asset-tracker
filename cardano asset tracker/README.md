# ðŸ§¾ Cardano Asset Tracker

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project provides a simple, lightweight way to **manually track all assets** (ADA and native tokens) stored in your **Cardano wallet** â€” without relying on third-party explorers, wallet apps, or external APIs.  

Itâ€™s designed for developers, power users, and anyone who wants to **verify their on-chain balances directly** from a stake address using Cardanoâ€™s **multi-asset ledger** model.

## âš¡ Key Features
- Query all wallet assets â€” ADA and native tokens â€” from a single stake address.  
- No dependency on external explorers or wallet applications.  
- Works locally or your self-host sever for enhanced privacy and control.  
- Simple, fast, and accurate.

## ðŸ§­ How It Works
Cardano uses a **multi-asset ledger**, which means all assets are natively recorded on-chain â€” no separate smart contracts per token (unlike EVM-based systems).

With this script, you can retrieve:
- Total ADA balance  
- Full list of native tokens (with Policy ID, token name, and quantity)  
- Output formatted in a readable summary
